# Museum-of-Candy
A responsive webpage built  with HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap 4 framework.
The site can be viewed here: https://vinith0601.github.io/Museum-of-Candy/

The site has no functionality and is just a mere demonstration of using CSS and Bootstrap4 to make the navbar and all the other elements resposive to screen size.
